### About

CTO at **Entitled Solutions** — I build across the entire stack, from distributed backends to polished frontends, from bare-metal DevOps to AI agent infrastructure. My recent obsession: **making coding agents actually good** by building the tooling layer they desperately need.

I believe the best developer tools are the ones that disappear. Code indexers that just *know* your codebase. Memory systems that learn from every session. Hooks that surface the right insight at the right time.

### Featured Projects

**[loregrep](https://github.com/Vasu014/loregrep)** &nbsp; ![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/Vasu014/loregrep?style=flat-square&color=70a5fd&label=) &nbsp; `Rust`
> A code indexing library that parses codebases into fast, searchable in-memory indexes — built for AI coding assistants. Uses tree-sitter for syntax analysis, supports structured queries across functions, structs, call graphs, and dependencies.

**[flashpods](https://github.com/Vasu014/flashpods)** &nbsp; `Python`
> Ephemeral VMs for agents. Spin up isolated, disposable compute environments on demand — because AI agents shouldn't run on your machine with root access.

**[feature-suggestor-hook](https://github.com/Vasu014/feature-suggestor-hook)** &nbsp; `TypeScript`
> A Claude Code hook that watches your codebase evolve and automatically surfaces feature opportunities. Scores ideas by readiness and effort, highlights quick wins, and decays stale suggestions over time.

**[ACE — Agentic Context Engineering](https://github.com/Vasu014/claude-session-learnings)**
> A self-improving memory system for Claude Code. Captures coding session insights, preserves context before it's lost, and builds an evolving playbook of strategies and antipatterns.

**[simple-coder](https://github.com/Vasu014/simple-coder)** &nbsp; `Rust`
> A from-scratch AI coding assistant — interactive terminal interface powered by Claude's API with file editing, project analysis, and multi-turn conversations.

**[raft-node](https://github.com/Vasu014/raft-node)** &nbsp; `TypeScript`
> A ground-up implementation of the **RAFT consensus algorithm** in Node.js with gRPC transport. Built to deeply understand distributed consensus.

### Background

**CTO — Entitled Solutions** &nbsp; *(current)*
> Building financial & insurance products for blue-collar workers in a B2B2C model. Own the full stack — architecture, frontend, backend, DevOps, and AI agent workflows.

**Founding Engineer — AI Meeting Assistant Startup**
> Built an AI meeting assistant in the pre-LLM era (think Fireflies.ai, but powered by LSTMs). Shipped the UI, stood up GCP infrastructure, and built the transcription analytics pipeline.

**Software Engineer — Citi**
> Started on the **Equities Smart Order Router** team, then moved across retail banking. Brought legacy systems onto modern DevOps pipelines, ran database migration projects, and built Talend ETL jobs.
